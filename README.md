# HosPal

HosPal is a job-searching mobile application for people in the medical field.
In addition to **helping people land jobs**, it also **assists employers in seeking out jobseekers/applicants.**

# Pitch
Over the span of the last few years and mainly due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, many countries over the world had to undergo a lockdown whilst also heavily relying on their frontline/healthcare workers to treat those affected by the virus, having the workers put their lives at risk in the process. Of course, the country of Malaysia is no exception to the rule. In the country alone, studies, conducted on a sample size of 893 healthcare workers, determined that the rate of prevalence of work-related burnouts to be 53.8%. Moreover, a somewhat similar study was carried out on a sample of 171 healthcare workers in order to assess the psychological conditions of such people and thus, concluded that the rate for suicidal thoughts amongst such individuals to be 11.1% whilst the rate of those suffering from clinical depression to be 9.9%, showcasing that suicidal behaviour within such individuals has become somewhat more common over the COVID-19 pandemic. Alas, it’s also been reported in areas such as Petaling Jaya, Sabah, Sarawak and other parts of Malaysia, especially rural areas, that, for some time now, there’s been a lack of certified medical experts and, even, housemen. ***Based on these studies, it’s shown that healthcare workers tend to suffer more from burnouts, stress and, sometimes, depression now more than ever over the last century at least, and this is mainly due to being overworked.***

In response to these issues, this mobile application (named 'HosPal') was designed for ***the purpose of seeking out jobs for medical/healthcare workers and aiding medical/healthcare employers***. This is meant to act as a means of employing both local and international medical workers or professionals to lessen the burden of having to overwork employees in healthcare. The target userbase of this application is meant to be limited to Android users initially. On top of that, the two primary users consist of ‘Jobseekers’ and ‘Employers’. Some of the features include applying for jobs at hospitals or clinics (in the form of job posts), creating a professional profile, uploading documentations (qualifications) and checking/reviewing other users’ public profiles. On top of that, Jobseekers are able to upload all their qualifications/documents in one location (their own private cloud storage that can house up to 1GB of file storage) within their account so that they can apply to multiple jobs easily and directly. This is very timesaving as it defies the need for users to have to resort to the traditional go-to method of having to fill up the same forms each time they were to apply for a job at a hospital. They are also be able to track the progress of each of their job applications (which can be reviewed and updated by Employers) through the app directly. In summary, this application aims to ease the hiring process of healthcare workers in multiple ways.
